<h5>Throw a coin 4 times, what's the probability we get 2 heads, 2 tails?</h5>

<h6>Answer: 3/8</h6>
<p>Total possible combinations of 4 coin tosses are 2^4=16. Getting 2 heads out of 4 toss: C(4,2)=6 possible ways. So the result is 3/8.<br/>
Another way to think is that we can treat the result as a 4bit binary sequence, all possible combinations are represented as 0000,0001,0010,...,1111. 2H2T combinations are: 1100,1010,1001,0110,0101,0011.
