<h5>5 people(A,B,C,D,E) sitting at a round table, what's the probability of A and B sitting next to each other?</h5>

<h6>Answer: 1/2</h6>
<p>Since we don't care about table rotation, we just pin A down at seat 1. There are 4! possible ways of sitting, amount them number of ways B sitting at seat 2 or seat 5: 2*3!. So the probability is (2*3!)/(4!)=1/2</p>
